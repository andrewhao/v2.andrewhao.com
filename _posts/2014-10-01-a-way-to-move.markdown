Oh my God, I'm cold. I guess I didn't imagine this on my retreat.
30MPH gusts blowing at me, stinging my face with snow bits. Nature is beautiful yet harsh, and I
realize that the City Boy in me is not quite cut out for this. We aren't
in Oakland any more.

Nobody is on this snow-covered trail. I am following moose tracks some ways in the
distance. I imagine it ambling toward me, at some earlier point in the
morning. Is it a moose? Or a horse? Paw prints emerge in the snow a bit
further on, and I wonder if there are mountain lions nearby.

That morning I drove up to Lake Brainard and was met with blasting winds
coming over the mountain pass. I changed my mind, *screw this*, and I
jumped back into the car and drove a few miles down the road, figuring
that I'd take a couple of miles of hiking in the forest to warm up before navigating through the lower lake.

Three hours and a mere six miles later, I'm at
Lake Isabelle, a frosty, glassy-blued alpine lake, and the sun has just
begun to warm me. Alas, the gusts are still there. I see two men make
their way up on the trail pass above, their voices echoing off the
mountain walls. The snow somehow makes their voices travel further, or
I'm really desperate for human contact.

I think of all the hikes I've taken with friends in the past and for a
moment, desperately wish they were here, just so I could stop feeling so
lonely, or to have some conversation to keep my mind turning.

Annie asked me the other day
what I think about when I'm running. Sometimes I'm singing a song in my
head, or other times I'm just picturing me entering the next trail. At
the moment, I'm envisioning how warm the car is and how good the bed is
going to feel. I've been turning over a phrase in my head for the past
couple of days: "A new way to be human." It's a line from a Switchfoot
song, and I have a suspicion that it has some significance for me here.

I meet more
backpackers coming back the other way: *High winds, no visibility, we're
turning around*. I make mental notes to go as far as I can, and realize
that honestly, I have no idea how I will know. Is it fear? Is it
physical tiredness?

In the end, I turn around because I'm cold.

The clouds are getting
darker and the gusts are biting more fiercely. I arrive at a snowy field at 12000 feet and look up. The
next climb is totally shrouded in a dark cloud. Two men are hurriedly
making their way down from the top. I shiver. Let's go home.

This solo retreat is exactly rooting
out the things I want and love. I desire the warmth of friendship, the
experience of beauty, the purpose of a journey. I did come here to be
alone, but I did also come here to find a new way to move and be human.
