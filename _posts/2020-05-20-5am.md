When 5AM comes, I tiptoe out of the house  
And revel in the stillness of the morning when breath is dew  
For seasons I imagined I was trapped on either side, with fitful sleep and nighttime duties but  
Here I am - we are at peace

My son, you amaze us at your wide-eyed wonder,  
you drive us nuts with your petulance

For the longest time I was helpless to watch as you overwhelmed us with need  
It was heard in our voices - pitch and tone - rising with desperation, resignedly soft or low and breathless with concern.  
Confusion

So in the early years I would escape at 5 AM and run as hard as I could  
Away, the spirit unsettled but the body resolute  
Away to a self that sought peace but found little  
Away

This morning there was peace - here.
