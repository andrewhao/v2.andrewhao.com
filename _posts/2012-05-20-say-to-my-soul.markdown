Through your own merciful dealings with me, O Lord my God, tell me what you are to me. Say to my soul, I am your salvation. Say it so that I can hear it. My heart is listening, Lord; open the ears of my heart and say to my soul, I am your salvation. Let me run towards this voice and seize hold of you. Do not hide your face from me: let me die so that I may see it, for not to see it would be death to me indeed.




— St. Augustine, _Confessions_


What I love is that Augustine asks God to move toward him -- _Say to my soul, I am your salvation_. I'm listening, he says, but I need you to speak it to me so it resonates with my soul.
