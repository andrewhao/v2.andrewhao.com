Ideas I'm toying with:



	
  * There is grace to be human, mess up and be accepted still.

	
  * There is forgiveness to be extended to humans who mess up.

	
  * There is freedom to say what's on your mind and be authentic.

	
  * There is just so much more freedom in general than I realize. I don't have to wear a mask.

	
  * Being assertive means at all times, I have the right to choose how I feel and how I act out of that.

	
  * If I mean my no's, then my yeses mean so much more.

	
  * The Gospel is real. It is powerful. It is what I/we/this world need(s).
