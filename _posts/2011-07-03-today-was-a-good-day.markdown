Channeling Ice Cube:



	
  * 94610 prayer walk with church community. Gary shared that doing these walks builds hope in us... helps us remember there's hope for Oakland. Give us eyes and ears and a heart for the city and our neighborhood. And afterwards I bought a brioche knot + a pizza slice at Arizmendi and 2 peaches from the farmer's market. Freakin good.

	
  * Did a 35-mile loop from Regen to Lake Chabot and back via Skyline with Eric and a friend. Nothing but godawful fatigue at the end. Came back and passed out for a good while.

	
  * Microwave TJ curry for dinner + a diet Coke someone left in the fridge. Amazing.

	
  * Sent Betty back with Kylan. Today I didn't mind.

	
  * Cleaned bathrooms and the kitchen, and enjoyed the alone time. Thought a lot about how I've changed this year.

	
  * Sat out in the night air for a few minutes and just took it in.


I don't know what it was about today but it just felt _good_. God's been good to me.
