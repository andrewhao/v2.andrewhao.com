Soon comes spring; and children will sigh in the rhododendron light. Forty days, the land groaned under the burden of frost and dust. I think to myself that were we to drink the ashen calendar days, we could not bear the surprise of heart-sick laughter, the lightness best experienced with others; a choked-up kind of glee that pounces suddenly without explanation. Does a bird think to itself, _thankgodi'malivethankgodi'malive_? I have a suspicion the children know; they have watched and waited for the light. Soon we, too, shall awaken.
