On the heels of that post and in a different spirit, I also want to say that I'm thoroughly enjoying this trip to Portland [with](my.opera.com/nosabe332) [some](stillhouette.com) [friends](themarrow.wordpress.com). Good eats, good company and a lot of coffee, food trucks, walking, cooking, good beer, beautiful runs, downtime, and trees.

That, plus like 30% of our waking time has been spent at this table at [Powell's City of Books](http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-city-of-books/). Books are cool, kids. I am reminded that I like words, particularly ones that are strung together nicely.
