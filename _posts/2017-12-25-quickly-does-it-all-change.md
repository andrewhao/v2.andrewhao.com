We came back home from your baptism last Sunday and you could not stop laughing, screeching with joy for twenty minutes (or what felt like forever).

In an instant, things become clearer than they ever have been before. I felt the dampness of tears on my face. How could I have doubted you?

Yusef told us once of being a dad and about the weight of looking into your son's face, seeing his entire future unfolded before him. I didn't know what he meant at the time, but I know a little better now.

You, the giggling one with eyes full of sky. Who are you?
