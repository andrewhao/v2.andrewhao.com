What do I have to offer you, brother?

My inability to move to action

My feeling of being stuck

Afraid of complicity, but uncomfortable with rushed action.

I want wise counsel and action but

I am uncomfortable, and they say this discomfort is good

But what can I offer you, my brother? When you have watched the system fail you time after time

Left you hunted, broken and beaten

What do I have to offer you?

What do we have to offer you?
