**I'd love your help!**

**Prayerfully:**








	
  * Unity within our intern group, the wisdom to know how to work through conflicts and disagreements, and the prayerful hearts needed to daily equip ourselves with the Gospel.

	
  * Humility to move in a cross-cultural context, laying down our assumptions and being open toseeing the Kingdom there.

	
  * Spiritual protection as we move into an unfamiliar spiritual landscape.

	
  * For the Kingdom to continue to move powerfully in dark places amidst poverty, spiritual strongholds and oppression.

	
  * Joy! That the church body there would ooze Gospel joy.

	
  * That the staff at the Red Window Project would be strengthened with supernatural rest, community, faith, hope, & love.
